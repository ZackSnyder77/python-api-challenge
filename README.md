# python-api-challenge

## NOTE: the Gmaps visuals were not displaying appropriately within Github so I saved additional PNG files of the Maps in the 
#"python-api-challenge/VacationPy/output_data" Directory.

Using a Mixture of skills learned in class, I am pulling a random list of cities and via the Openweather API, I am mapping in their key weather details along with their Latitude and Longitude Coordinates.



Saving the data for these 500+ cities, I use the Google Maps API to generate a humidity heatmap of all the cities.  Additionally for a select few cities based on temperature, cloudiness and wind speed, I find the nearest hotel to them and plot their locations on the Humidity based Heatmap
